    "#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.\n",

    "Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data is distributed in over each label\n",

    "\n",
    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step i equalized the training dataset so that each class of image has the same number of datapoints, so the dataset now has even distribution. This is done by adding augmented images on the basis of the already existing ones of each class. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images_out/augmentation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I not only filled up classes with less images I basically extended the amount of data even for the class with the most original images by factor two. So the new distribution with about 175000 images looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images_out/data_set_equalized.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I converted the images to the YUV colorspace for further processing as recommended by [Lecun et. al.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). Then the Y-Channel is equalized so the maximum Y-Value (Grayscale) for each image is 255 and the lowest 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images_out/y_channel_normalization.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At last all channels of the images are converted to a range -1 to 1 for better convergency properties of the fitting algorithm of the neural network, as given in the lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As given in [Lecun et. al.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf) a simplified variant of the given architectures is used here. This network is chosen as it already gave pretty good results for a traffic sign detection usecase.\n",

    " For instance due to the limited data set, the number of convolutions are set to a mimimum. However, a similar combination gave valid results in the mentioned paper. Additionally a dropout in the second layer is introduced to improve robustness. For the sake of computational performance, the parallel feedtrough of the first layer into the fully-connected hidden layer is ommit as it would introduce plenty of additional parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the adam-optimization as suggested in the lessons. A batch size of 512 proved to be useful as it allowed me to train the model at my local machine.\n",
    "The optimization of the network for the augemented training data is done using almmost an infinite number of epoches. The termination criteria here was the accuracy of the augmentated data, which should be less than 0.5%. The results of the accuracy and loss can be seen here:\n",

    "\n",
    "After training the augmented data, i combined the validation data in order to get better results for the test data. From my point of view this is reasonable, as the would throw valuable data away. The retraining results are visible here:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 0.999\n",
    "* training set augmented accuracy of 0.996\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 0.972\n",
    "* training set augmented + validation set accuracy of 0.993\n",

The some of the other images are view from a different perspective, which was not covered as augmentation in the enlargment procedure of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric).\n",

For the two-signs-in-one-image case the net did not find the correct answer, but the yield-sign was estimated with the second best probability and the roundabout-sign with the 4th best probability.
